JS Interactive Dashboard Challenge

## Background

In this assignment, I built an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.
The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

### Create a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.

### Create a bubble chart that displays each sample.

### Display the sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information.
